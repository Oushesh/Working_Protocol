## Working_Protocol

## Hardware Macbook M2 Pro or Dell Inspiron Slim Computer with Ubuntu 20 LTS for dev
   By preference on Mac:
   * install brew or MacPorts on Macbook: https://brew.sh/
   * install macPorts from here: (advantage you get things as .dpkg like in ubuntu or linux)

My working protocol and daily routine as a Software Engineer in AI and Deep Learning

0800 - 1200 (less meetings) (more time to think)

## 1400 - 1600 (coding)

## 1900 -- 2100 (thinking time)

There are 2 stages of great work: Thinking Time and Execution Time. It does not overlap that much.

## Calendar (Google Calendar connected with cron app)
    ## Most of my calendar is built with Focus Time (http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)

## Tools I use:
    Python: PyCharm with Github Co-pilot
    Reat.js, Next.js: Webstorm 
    
## Working Rythm

## AI Development
   Protoyping: jupyter notebook and google colab spaces.
   In house training session: tmux on ubuntu linux lineup
   
   Github codespaces:
   Github Copilot: 

## API Dev:
   Good practice to use: postman api and test

## Backend
   * AuthO: check for authentification status in the app (Follow the tutorial and test it)
   

## Deployment:
   * add .env where all URLs, keys_api and payload get found
   * My style: docker, docker compose up (.yaml file) --> improvement on it is: docker compose with cache. (docker setup on mac) (TODO)
   * 
## Frontend
   * Next.js, tailwind.css (only) since I have an eye for design I will check if we can build this with AI (huge thing here)
   * tailwind.css 
   * Since I am an AI engineer, I use chat.openai.com to help navigate through the process of designing the app.

## My say on User Experience:
   * AuthO on user experience

## Github
   Since I code mostly in Python and Next.js (javascript), for python I use the pre-commit to
   ensure code quality: https://pre-commit.com/. Pre-commit helps me style the code professionally
   every time I push a new code.
   
   To save time I also use the (☑️ ✔️  button from pycharm and the macbook M2 sidebar). This saves time avoiding typing commands onto Terminal or iTerm2 which I currently use for better fonts.
