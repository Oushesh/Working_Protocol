## Working_Protocol
My working protocol and daily routine as a Software Engineer in AI and Deep Learning

0800 - 1200 (less meetings) (more time to think)

## 1400 - 1600 (coding)

## 1900 -- 2100 (thinking time)

There are 2 stages of great work: Thinking Time and Execution Time. It does not overlap that much.

## Calendar (Google Calendar connected with cron app)
    ## Most of my calendar is built with Focus Time (http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)

## Tools I use:
    Python: PyCharm with Github Co-pilot
    Reat.js, Next.js: Webstorm 
    
## Working Rythm

## AI Development

## Backend
   * AuthO: check for authentification status in the app.
   
## Frontend

## My say on User Experience:
   * AuthO on user experience
